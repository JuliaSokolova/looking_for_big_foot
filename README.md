# Looking for Big Foot with NLP Unsupervised Learning

A data set of bigfoot sighting reports was collected from the <a href='http://www.bfro.net/gdb/'>Geographic Database of Bigfoot / Sasquatch Sightings & Reports</a>.
We explored the dataset using basic data exploratory algorithms, Natural Language Processing and Topic Modeling with NMF libraries.
